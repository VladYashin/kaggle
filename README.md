Mastering algorithms, data structures &amp; data science concepts on kaggle datasets

In this repo you can find several notebooks, where I've tried to implement step for step different models, concepts, algorithms and data structures. 
This repo is pure learning by doing for me as a self-taught data scientist. 


I appreciate it, if you can take something from them:)

Best regards,
