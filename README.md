Mastering algorithms, data structures &amp; data science concepts on kaggle datasets

In this repo you can find several notebooks, where I've tried to implement step for step different models, concepts, algorithms. Also these notebooks are full of data visualizations, feature engineering, EDA etc.
This repo is pure learning by doing. 


I appreciate it, if you can take something from them:)
